## Specifications

### Entities

#### User

We need to add the following column to the Users table:

| Column               | Type   | Null    | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `role`               | string | `false` | The user's role in the application. Can be `user`, `moderator`, or `admin`.        |
| `username`           | string | `false` | The user's display name. This will allow other users to find them. Must be unique. |
| `usernameNormalized` | string | `false` | The normalized version of the username, for search queries. Must be unique.        |
| `gravatarHash`       | string | `true`  | A hash to associate the user's email with a Gravatar image.                        |

The role will be set to `user` for all existing users. There won't be a way to manually change this for now, but it will be useful to implement the appropriate permission checks for the API. The column `isSuperAdmin` will be removed.

The username columns are not nullable, so the migration will set their value to the left part (before the `@`) of the `email` and `emailNormalized` columns. This is to prevent having incomplete users in the database, so this will reduce the number of filters we need to apply when querying the database.

For the `gravatarHash`, the migration will need to iterate programmatically over all users and set the value to the SHA-256 hash of their `emailNormalized` column.

#### Bingo

The Bingo entity represents an event where users can participate. It is a strong paranoid entity, but we won't mention these columns. It will have the following columns:

| Column          | Type     | Null    | Description                                                                                                                                                |

### Commands

#### `CreateUserCommand`

The command must now fail if the requester isn't `'self'`, or an admin.

The command will be modified to include the username. The `usernameNormalized` column will be set to the normalized version of the username. The `gravatarHash` will be set to the SHA-256 hash of the `emailNormalized` column.

#### `SignInWithEmailCommand`

This command will send an email even if the user doesn't exist. The Redis key will be `auth:email:<emailNormalized>`, and the value will now be:

```json
{
  "action": "sign-in",
  "email": "string"
}
```

#### `SignUpWithEmailCommand`

```ts
type Params = {
  email: string;
  username: string;
};
```

If the username's normalized version already exists, the command will fail. If the email already exists, the user will be sent a sign in code via email.

Otherwise, the user will receive a sign up code via email. The code will be saved in Redis, just like sign in codes, but it will contain the username as well. The key will be `auth:email:<emailNormalized>`, and the value will be:

```json
{
  "action": "sign-up",
  "email": "string",
  "username": "string"
}
```

#### `SignOutSessionByUuidCommand`

This command must now fail if the requester isn't the owner of the session, or an admin.

#### `UpdateUserCommand`

```ts
type Params = {
  requester: User;
  username: string;
  updates: {
    username?: string;
    language?: 'en' | 'fr';
  };
};
```

Allows the user to update their username and language. The command must fail if:

- the user doesn't exist
- the requester is neither the user nor a moderator or admin
- the new username is invalid or already taken
- the new language is invalid

The new username will be normalized and saved in the `usernameNormalized` column.

An `UserUpdatedEvent` will then be emitted.

#### Other commands

Since the [API endpoints](#api-endpoints) section will be pretty comprehensive, we'll simply list the commands we need to implement:

- `AddBingoTileCommand`: Adds a tile to a bingo event.
- `UpdateBingoTileCommand`: Updates a tile in a bingo event.
- `DeleteBingoTileCommand`: Deletes a tile from a bingo event.
- `SubmitTileCompletionCommand`: Submits a tile completion request.
- `AcceptTileCompletionCommand`: Approves a tile completion request.

### Events

#### `UserUpdatedEvent`

```ts
type Params = {
  userId: string;
  requesterId: string;
  updates: {
    username?: string;
    language?: 'en' | 'fr';
  };
};
```

The event handler will create an activity with key `user.updated` and the event payload as the parameters.

#### Other events

Here is a list of the other events we need to implement:

- `BingoCreatedEvent`: A new bingo event has been created.
- `BingoUpdatedEvent`: A bingo event has been updated.
- `BingoStartedEvent`: A bingo event has started.
- `BingoEndedEvent`: A bingo event has ended.
- `BingoCancelledEvent`: A bingo event has been cancelled.
- `BingoDeletedEvent`: A bingo event has been deleted.
- `BingoApplicationCreatedEvent`: A user applied to join a bingo.
- `BingoApplicationAcceptedEvent`: A bingo application was accepted.
- `BingoApplicationRejectedEvent`: A bingo application was rejected.
- `BingoInvitationCreatedEvent`: A user was invited to a bingo.
- `BingoInvitationAcceptedEvent`: A bingo invitation was accepted.
- `BingoInvitationRejectedEvent`: A bingo invitation was rejected.
- `BingoParticipantAddedEvent`: A user was added to a bingo.
- `BingoParticipantRemovedEvent`: A user was removed from a bingo.
- `BingoParticipantUpdatedEvent`: A participant’s role or team was updated.
- `BingoTeamCreatedEvent`: A team was created within a bingo.
- `BingoTeamUpdatedEvent`: A team was updated.
- `BingoTeamDeletedEvent`: A team was deleted.
- `BingoTileCreatedEvent`: A tile was added to a bingo.
- `BingoTileUpdatedEvent`: A tile was updated.
- `BingoTileDeletedEvent`: A tile was deleted.
- `BingoTileCompletionSubmittedEvent`: A tile completion was submitted.
- `BingoTileCompletionAcceptedEvent`: A tile completion was accepted.
- `BingoTileCompletionRejectedEvent`: A tile completion was rejected.

### Queries

First, we'll need helper queries for pagination; one with total count and the other without total count. Running a SQL count on large tables can be expensive, so we'll use the second one for Bingos and Users.

We will define one type for paginated query params and two for paginated results:

```ts
type PaginatedQueryParams = {
  limit: number;
  offset: number;
};

type PaginatedQueryResult<T> = {
  items: T[];
  limit: number;
  offset: number;
  total: number;
};

type PaginatedQueryResultWithoutTotal<T> = {
  items: T[];
  limit: number;
  offset: number;
  hasPreviousPage: boolean;
  hasNextPage: boolean;
};
```

The `limit` parameter will default to 20 and limit to 50 to prevent large default queries. The `offset` parameter will default to 0.

To get `hasPreviousPage`, we simply check if the `offset` is greater than 0. To get `hasNextPage`, we run the initial query with `limit + 1` and check if the number of results is greater than `limit`, then we remove the last item from the results.

#### `VerifyEmailCodeQuery`

This query needs to be modified to return the code's payload in object form, so the controller can decide what it needs to do with it; either sign in or sign up the user.

#### Other queries

Since the [API endpoints](#api-endpoints) section will be pretty comprehensive, we'll simply list the queries we need to implement:

- `GetBingosQuery`: Retrieves a paginated list of bingo events.
- `GetBingoByIdQuery`: Retrieves a specific bingo event by its ID.
- `GetBingoParticipantsQuery`: Retrieves a list of participants for a bingo.
- `GetBingoTeamsQuery`: Retrieves all teams for a bingo.
- `GetBingoTilesQuery`: Retrieves all tiles for a bingo.
- `GetBingoTileByCoordinatesQuery`: Retrieves a specific tile in a bingo board.
- `GetBingoTileCompletionsQuery`: Retrieves tile completions for a bingo.
- `GetBingoApplicationsQuery`: Retrieves applications for a bingo.
- `GetBingoInvitationsQuery`: Retrieves invitations for a bingo.
- `GetUserByUsernameQuery`: Retrieves a user by their username.
- `GetUsersQuery`: Searches for users by username.

### API endpoints

We will add a `/v1` prefix to all the API endpoints. That way, when we introduce breaking changes, we can divide up the project into different versions without breaking existing applications.

#### Pagination

For search queries, we handle parameters with the `limit` and `offset` query parameters. These parameters are **always optional**.

| Field    | Default | Max |
| -------- | ------- | --- |
| `limit`  | 20      | 50  |
| `offset` | 0       | ∞   |
